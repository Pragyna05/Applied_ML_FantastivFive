# In this project, we have designed, implemented and analyzed a song recommendation system. We used Million Song Dataset provided by kaggle to find correlations between users and songs and to learn from the previous listening history of users to provide recommendations for songs which users would prefer to listen most. We have got the best results for memory based collaborative filtering algorithm.
